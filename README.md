My professional path began in the creative industries, where I spent several years in digital postproduction and CGI. Over time, I moved into leadership positions, managing teams and client relationships, and gaining a deep understanding of project workflows and business dynamics. Key milestones include promotions to team manager, overseeing departmental budgets, and coordinating cross-functional projects. More recently, I’ve taken a strategic turn toward data, combining my visual expertise with analytical skills to explore new opportunities in data analytics, and digital marketing.

My educational background began in the arts and design, laying a solid foundation in visual communication and aesthetics. Throughout the years, I’ve continued to upskill — completing a Master’s in Data Analytics and specialized courses in Python, SQL, data visualization, digital analytics... This continuous learning reflects a commitment to evolving with the industry and aligning my skills with the growing demand for data-driven decision-making.

## From team & project management to Data Analytics
